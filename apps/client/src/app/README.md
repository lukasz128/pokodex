In main folder we have a feature routed sections. For example in folder clients everythink is in route /client.
In every routed feature we have a four folders (not always need all four).

### Feature folder

feature folders is responsible for holding all our routed components for that particual feature. There are smart components

### UI folder

### Data access

Everything related to accessing data, things like services, stores, interface, mockups. Smart components are going to pulling in information from this data

### Utils

Helpers functions

Shared folders as feature has a almost the same structure like feature section, but probably won't have a smart components

In shell folder we create a router file of all feature
